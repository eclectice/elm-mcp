  ELM MCP - one-command installer for Windows (PowerShell).

  Run this in PowerShell:

    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclectice/elm-mcp/main/install.ps1 | iex

  It clones the repo to %USERPROFILE%\.elm-mcp, runs setup.py to wire up
  your AI host (IBM Bob, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf), prompts
  for your ELM credentials, and installs the 5 custom Bob modes. Re-running
  it later updates the clone in place and re-runs setup. Idempotent.

  This is the Windows counterpart to install.sh (Mac/Linux). The core
  setup.py is identical and cross-platform - this script just handles the
  clone + Python detection the PowerShell way.

  NOT an official IBM product. Personal passion project. Use at your own risk.
#>

# IMPORTANT - why the whole script body lives inside this `& { ... }` block:
#
# The documented install path is `irm ... | iex`, which runs this script's
# text directly in YOUR live PowerShell session - there is no script-file
# boundary. In that context a bare `exit` terminates the host process, so
# the window closes instantly and you never get to read the error. (That's
# the "it just closes out right away" bug.)
#
# Wrapping everything in `& { ... }` + try/catch and using `throw` instead of
# `exit` fixes that: on failure the catch prints the reason and the window
# STAYS OPEN. The block also gives the script its own scope, so it doesn't
# leave $ErrorActionPreference="Stop" (or any temp variable) behind in your
# session after it runs.

    $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
